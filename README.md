# Password Generator Starter Code

Bootcamp Module-3-Challenge to create a random password generator.

For challenge assignments that include starter code, remember that there are few steps we need to take before we start coding to make sure that 1) we’re working in our own repository rather than the one containing the starter code and 2) we’re setting up our file structure so that index.html deploys properly:
Create your own Github repo (including a README file)
Clone the new repo onto your computer
Either clone the starter code from the link provided in Bootcamp Spot/Canvas or access the starter code in the class GitLab repo
Copy all of the files/folders contained inside the /Develop folder
Note: we don’t want to actually include /Develop in our own repo because it will prevent index.html from deploying correctly
Paste the copied files into your own Github repository that you cloned in step 2
Add, commit, and push the starter code to Github
You’re ready!
Taking these steps before you start work on an assignment with starter code will ensure that you’re setting future you up for success. :rocket:
